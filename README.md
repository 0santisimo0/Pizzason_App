## Introduction

The following project was developed by the "Equison" team, with the aim of achieving a "virtual waiter" for a Pizza
restaurant. It should be noted that the project was carried out following the steps of the Scrum Methodology.

## Description

The project consists in the realization of a "Virtual Waiter" for a pizza restaurant, for which the following main 
objectives are had: to have a Splash Screen with the name of the restaurant when starting the program, to have the menu 
of pizzas, to have discounts for combos, to be able to buy extra products only after having bought a pizza before, to be 
able to modify the order after completing the order. The project was built on Java 17 along with tools like IntelliJ and 
GitLab using the Branching model for the workflow.

## Process

The designated project in the matter of Software Development was started on Wednesday, June 22 with the "Sprint Planning"

Jhael Arce, Santiago Caballero and Leonardo Herrera (Development Team). On Saturday, June 25, the development of the
